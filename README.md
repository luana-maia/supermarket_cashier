## ðŸ›’ Interactive Checkout:

You can also test the checkout interactively with different products and quantities using:
```bash
ruby interactive_checkout.rb
```
**Instructions:**
- The system will show all available products and prices.
- Enter the product code and quantity separated by a space (e.g., GR1 2).
- Repeat for each product you want to add.
- Type 'done' when finished.
- The system will display all scanned products and the total amount applying all pricing rules (BOGO, Bulk Discount, Coffee Discount).

Example interaction:
```bash
Enter product code and quantity (e.g., GR1 2) or 'done': GR1 2
2 x Green tea added to cart.
Enter product code and quantity (e.g., GR1 2) or 'done': SR1 3
3 x Strawberries added to cart.
Enter product code and quantity (e.g., GR1 2) or 'done': CF1 3
3 x Coffee added to cart.
Enter product code and quantity (e.g., GR1 2) or 'done': done
